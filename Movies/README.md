# Movies Industry
Is the movie industry dying? Is Netflix the new entertainment king? Those were the first questions that led me to create a dataset
Focused on movie revenue and analyze it over the last decades. But why stop there? There are more factors that intervene in this
kind of thing, like actors, genres, user ratings and more. And now, anyone with experience (you) can ask specific questions about the
movie industry, and get answers.

<h1>Key Components:</h1>

Data Preparation: Tackled the raw data intricacies head-on, ensuring it was structured, relevant, and ready for analysis.

<h1>Conclusion:</h1>


This project demonstrates how we can transform raw information into actionable insights, helping businesses and enthusiasts make informed decisions in the ever-evolving film industry.
For this project, I had the opportunity to analyze a diverse dataset of movies spanning different genres, release years, and box office performances.
 
The primary objective was to extract meaningful insights from the data and present them in an interactive and visually compelling manner .

EDA isn't just about numbers; it's about storytelling through data. By analyzing this movie dataset, I gained valuable insights that can inform marketing, production, and distribution decisions in the film industry.
