<h1>Insights from the project: </h1>

* Make Exploratory Data Analysis

1.Day of week : From the graph, we can see that the days when there are the most consumers are Tuesday and Wednesday

2.Total steps : From the graph, we can see that the higher the total steps, the more calories

3.Total hours : From the graph, we can see that the higher the total hours, the higher the calories, but the relationship between them is weak due to the less active minutes.

4.SedentaryMinutes : From the chart, we can see that SedentaryMinutes is larger than LightlyActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, and VeryActiveMinutes,
The LightlyActiveMinutes are larger than the FairlyActiveMinutes and VeryActiveMinutes , This may be because people use the product to record normal activities, not for exercising.


<h1>Conclusion:</h1>

By the end of this project, we want to provide recommendations and guidance to stakeholders to improve the companyâ€™s marketing strategy through the graphical visualizations that emerged. We conclude that the majority of users, about 81.3%, use the application to track daily activities and regular activities. They do not use it to follow exercise and monitor their health habits.
We also conclude that the user prefers to track his activity during the weekdays, from mid- to late-week, compared to weekends.
How to improve the company's marketing strategy so that the marketing team can encourage and educate the product so that the user understands how to use it and suggest exercises to them and provide them with information about the rate of burning calories.
